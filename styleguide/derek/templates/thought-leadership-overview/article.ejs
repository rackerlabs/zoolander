        In developing its strategy to move to the AWS cloud, TMG selected Rackspace as its managed public cloud service provider of choice. Because the

        maintaining HIPAA compliance.

      <h2 class="rsTl-article-header">Creating a multi-layered security strategy</h2>
      <p>
        TMG’s commitment to compliance and security is key to dealing with today’s rapidly innovating threat and complex regulatory environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Security remains the top concern for companies moving to the cloud, and it’s no wonder. A single breach can cost millions, permanently scare away
        customers and even take down the entire organization. For healthcare companies like TMG, ransomeware attacks are now the number one threat. All
        types of attacks are becoming more sophisticated, and dwell time remains high, at 78 days. It is common for organizations to go months before they
        realize they’ve been hacked, while most attacks succeed and begin exfiltrating data in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So how can organizations reduce the risk of a cybersecurity attack and business-impacting downtime? Secure everything and maintain compliance. That
        means being prepared to address human error, vulnerabilities and cyberattacks, while complying with and maintaining data security and other industry
        compliance standards.

      <h2 class="rsTl-article-header">Finding that “key strategic partner”</h2>
      <p>
        As TMG began working with AWS to understand the capabilities and challenges of cloud computing, AWS recommended Rackspace as a trusted partner
        that could provide TMG with the expertise to build, manage and optimize a secure and compliant environment in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        TMG engaged Rackspace to assist in the AWS environment design and build, and to provide ongoing operations and security services for its new AWS
        production environment, including ensuring that TMG met or exceeded requirements for both HIPAA and PCI DSS Level 1 compliance audits.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We have been impressed by how well the Rackspace solutions work with all of the new AWS developments,” said Scott P. Jones, Chief Information Officer
        at TMG. “Rackspace provides us with deep subject matter expertise, delivers a wide variety of services that are critical to our operations in the cloud, and
        plays an important role in helping us meet our compliance standards. Rackspace is a key strategic partner for The Macaluso Group.”
