  h3 Landing Page Examples and Best Practices
  .col-md-6
    h4.red DO
    ul.checks
      li Introduce your brand identity to build continuity and recognition.
      li Start building trust right away (logos, quotes, testimonials)
      li Keep the form short and sweet - companies lose a lot of people with long forms
      li Keep copy short and purposeful
      li Have one strong cta, if you feel like you need a second one then you probably need another lp
      li Try to emphasize benefits of your products not features, most people, aside from technical roles will be looking for how this helps them, not tech specs
      li Know your audience! Device, region, segment, role, find out where they are coming from and write to them
      li Avoid distractions - no nav bar, no typical footer, no sliders.
      li Make absolute sure it matches your ad - and that it will match the page they are redirected to. Continuity is king.
      li Set up consistent landing pages and test to perfection.
      li If it's for a different region - instead of translations, utilize a native speaking copy writer, vernacular can differ greatly from region to region and people can tell when an ad wasn’t tailored for their market
  .col-md-6
    h4.red DON'T
    ul.times
      li Don't be afraid of imagery here - feels personal
      li Don't use jargon or “did you knows”
      li Don’t be desperate, avoid leaving pop ups and over advertising to different segments
      li Don't use multiple CTAs. Your page should have one clear purpose.
      li Don't introduce too much noise, both on page and across templates. Cleaner is better, we want to focus on that primary cta.
