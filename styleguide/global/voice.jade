    h5.red Voice
    p At its core, our voice is always human. Because that’s what we are, how we talk and who we talk to. And it doesn’t matter if it’s marketing copy, phone calls, emails or notes on the fridge (see how we said “fridge” and not “refrigerator?” Friendly, like that), Rackers talk to the world the way we want to be spoken to: with helpful words and phrases that are informative, simple, clear and easy to understand.
    p But since we’re a technology company, sometimes there’s only one right word or phrase, and it has more than two syllables. We avoid needless jargon, but in the right context, we don’t flinch from using words like MapReduce or /.htaccess. And while our audience and customers include some very technical folks who want simple descriptions for how something works or affects them, they don’t want anything dumbed down.
  .col-md-6
    h5.red Tone
    p Everything we say should create feelings of inspiration and empowerment in our audiences. We accomplish this by providing them with relevant insights and solutions, by using straightforward, relatable language, and by connecting with them on a personal level.

  h2 Helpful Tips
  h5.red Here are a few more tips to help you keep your voice and tone sounding like a Racker.
  ul
    li Try to write how you’d speak, so your words are more authentic, honest and natural.
    li It’s also OK (encouraged, actually) to use contractions, like “I’ll,” “we’ll” and “haven’t.”
    li But avoid informal spellings, like “wanna” and “gotta.”
    li Simplify complex phrases without diluting them.
    li Short and simple is (almost) always better.
    li Sentence fragments are OK when used for special emphasis. Just like this.
    li And we don’t mind sentences that start with conjunctions.
    li Asking questions for rhetorical effect is OK as long as you answer them right away.

  h5.red Lists:
  p Generally avoid using the “Oxford comma” or “serial comma.” That means if you’re listing three or more things, avoid using a comma to precede the last item in the list.

  h6 Exceptions:
  ul
  li Its removal would alter the meaning of the phrase.
  li Its removal would impede understandability of the phrase.
  li You’re using it to separate long, more-complicated lists, as in “…horses without homes, dogs without bones, and rabbits who like to read”.
  li The context of your writing is more formal.
  li The last item in your list has “and” in it already, as in “dogs, rabbits, and goods and services”.

    h5.red Terminal Punctuation &amp; Spacing:
    p We always put punctuation at the end of our sentences, but when it comes to captions, callouts and other shortened phrases, you only need a period at the end if the phrase has a verb in it. And we prefer one space after periods. Period.

    h5.red Dashes &amp; Hyphens:
    p Use em dashes (the long ones) when you need to create a pause in a sentence. Use en dashes only in number ranges. Use hyphens to join words together. Include a space before and after the em dash.

    h5.red This is just a formality
    p The Rackspace voice is conversational, friendly and confident. But it’s also adaptable. So when it comes to our communications, the level of formality will vary slightly depending on our audience.

    h5.red but if you want to get technial...
    p Let’s face it. Not everyone’s ready for “fully isolated, single-tenant Layer 2 networks” or “complex network traffic topologies.” Feel free to embrace your inner Racker when you’re talking to CIOs and CTOs, but tone it down if someone doesn’t know their USB port from their power supply.

    p Let’s put it all together now. Here’s a chart that shows a basic guideline for the level of technicality and formality you can aim for when talking to different target audiences.
