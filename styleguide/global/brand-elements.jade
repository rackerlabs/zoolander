    h2.no-margin Logo
  .col-md-6
    p The corporate logo serves as the dominant brand that embodies the characteristics of Rackspace over all other brands. Every deviation from the master logo dilutes our brand. We protect our brand by honoring the brand guidelines and limiting the creation of Rackspace sub-brands. The Rackspace logo stands alone.

    p INSERT LOGO
    p Our logo is made up of two elements displayed in a specific arrangement — the “Fanatiguy icon” and the “Rackspace” word-mark. With few exceptions, this is how it should be displayed regardless of media or application.

    h5.red Clear Space
    p Our logos require space between them and other design elements. This padding helps to keep them visible and recognizable. The amount of space can be generous, but can’t be too small. A good way of knowing if you’ve allowed enough space is to measure using the height of the “k”. Apply the same space rule to all variations of the logo.

    h5.red At small sizes
    p We created a version of our logo that is optimized for use at small sizes or on low fidelity applications. This “small use optimized” version has enlarged cutouts in some of the letters to keep them looking sharp — even when small.
    p As a general rule, this version should not be used at sizes over two inches wide.

    h5.red Full Color
  .col-md-6
    p Our full-color logo uses our two main brand colors — black and red. The word-mark (including our tagline) and right half of the Fanatiguy icon is black and the left half of the Fanatiguy icon is red. Please do not swap this color arrangement.

    h5.red Single Color
  .col-md-6
    p While we are partial to black and red, it isn’t always possible to reproduce our logo in full color. When those times arise, please use a single color version in red, black or white. The rule for creating a single-color version is easy. Choose a color and use it (at the same opacity/tint/saturation) for every element in the logo.

    p Fanatiguy is our logo mark. That means he’s more than just any old icon. He’s us. The symbol of every Racker and everything we stand for. And if you change him, you don’t just change his meaning — you change ours. So leave him as he is and let him do what he does best.
    p The corporate logo and corporate icon are both available in a two-color version that is red and black — red is always on the left side and black is always on the right side. It is also acceptable to use in any single solid color.

    h5.red Spray Texture
    p A spray texture adds a human, hands-on element to the visual identity of our brand. Overlaid on top of other elements, it will create depth and is symbolic of the lens that Rackers see the world through.
    h6 Usage:
    p This texture can be used as a color field or border or simply overlaid over small sections of photography (excluding faces), and can also be used in various shapes and sizes. This texture can be used in red, blue, yellow, gray or black. In larger applications, a “tighter” version of the spray may be used to reduce noise and edge inconsistency if desired. There are a raster and vector versions of this texture.

    h5.red Icons and Ideograms
  .col-md-8
    p Ideograms are created with elements from our icon library and line art to demonstrate depth of expertise, knowledge sharing and ultimately represent the way we think and arrive at solutions.
    h6 Usage:
    p These illustrations are used in negative space around people, as smaller stand-alone pieces, and paired with icons to add context. When the ideogram is paired with a photo, and has prominence to the communication, a dark gray should be used. Where possible, the line art in the illustration can connect to a text headline or run off a page. This has limited use on the web.
    h6 Alternate version:
    p A light gray version of the ideogram illustration can be used in applications where other elements need hierarchical value.
